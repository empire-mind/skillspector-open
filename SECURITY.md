# Security Policy — skillspector-open

## Status

This project is **pre-v1**: no tagged release exists yet. The supported
version is `main` (see the table below).

## Supported versions

| Version         | Supported with security updates |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| `main` (pre-v1) | ✅                               |

Security fixes land on `main`. Once versioned releases exist, the latest
release will also receive security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for a security vulnerability.**

Use GitHub's **private vulnerability reporting**: on this repository's page,
open the **Security** tab and choose **"Report a vulnerability"**. Your
report stays visible only to you and the maintainers until a fix is ready
and a public advisory is published.

What to include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (the exact scanner invocation and repo under scan)
- The potential impact
- A suggested fix, if you have one

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Vulnerabilities in the scanner code (`slop-scan.py`, check modules, docs
  generators) on this repository's default branch
- Supply-chain issues in declared dependencies (see the Dependabot note
  below)
- Misconfigurations in this repository's CI workflows

**Out of scope:**

- Theoretical issues without a plausible exploit path
- Findings in forked copies or stale branches
- Social engineering or physical attacks
- False positives from the heuristic checks — those are the FP-audit
  process working as designed; file them as ordinary issues so the check's
  documented FP table improves

## Response expectations

We will acknowledge your report within **7 calendar days**. For confirmed
issues we will share a remediation plan or timeline within **14 days** of
acknowledgement. We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly
until a fix is available.

## Secret scanning and Dependabot

- GitHub **secret scanning** and **push protection** are enabled on this
  repository.
- **Dependabot security updates** are enabled.
- CI runs on every pull request and must be green before merge.
- Org-level policy: [empire-mind/.github SECURITY.md](https://github.com/empire-mind/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
